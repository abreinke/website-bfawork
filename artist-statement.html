<h1><center>Artist Statement</center></h1>
<p>I remember that someone once said, "If you aren't passionate about what you're doing, you shouldn't be doing it."  While I can't put a finger on who came up with this saying, they're words that couldn't speak to me more than they do right now and they're a reminder that digital art is one of my greatest passions.  I can often find myself spending hours in the world of digital media, whether it's creating digital collages with the latest Adobe tools or strategizing with code so my final piece is functional and has meaning.</p>
